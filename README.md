# Vision Captioner

## Overview

This repos demonstrates the capabilities of the PaliGemma model for image understanding tasks. It provides a framework for generating descriptive captions for images, identifying objects within images, and extracting text using optical character recognition (OCR). By leveraging PaliGemma's powerful multimodal understanding, this project showcases how to create comprehensive image descriptions.

## Features

* **Image Captioning:** Automatically generates human-readable captions for images using the PaliGemma language model.
* **Image Detection:** Identifies objects, people, or scenes within images to provide detailed descriptions.
* **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Extracts text from images, enabling understanding of embedded information.
* **Multimodal Understanding:** Combines visual and textual analysis for comprehensive image comprehension.
